// credits a finish to the reading-stats session, applies the move-to-/COMPLETED
// and remove-from-recents settings, then navigates home or to the next book.
// On cancel/stay the host gets a requestUpdate() to re-render its last page.
// The caller is responsible for persisting reading progress beforehand (the
// progress formats differ per reader).
// `onMenuClosed` (optional, with `onMenuClosedCtx`) runs first in the result
// handler regardless of outcome — readers use it to clear a "menu is open"
// flag. Plain function pointer + context instead of std::function per the
// project callback convention.
// `onSyncToKOReader` (optional, with `onSyncToKOReaderCtx`), when non-null, offers a "sync
// progress to KOReader" toggle (only when KOReader credentials are also configured) alongside
// the move-to-/COMPLETED and forget-book toggles. Unlike those two, applying it isn't a plain
// settings write: it's invoked in place of navigating away directly, with the book's current
// path (which may already be the moved-to-/COMPLETED path — the move/forget settings are still
// applied first, "in parallel" rather than replaced), a KOReaderSyncPostAction describing which
// of Go Home / Open Next / Search OPDS was picked, and that action's target (next-book path or
// OPDS author, empty for Go Home). The callback owns pushing progress and, once its own reboot
// completes, performing that action itself (EpubReaderActivity is the only caller that supplies
// one, since KOReader sync is EPUB-only).
// It returns whether it actually took over: the sync path REPLACES this flow's own navigation, so
// a callback that declines (no credentials, no live Epub to read a position from) must say so or
// the user is left sitting on a dead screen with nothing having happened. False means "I did not
// navigate", and the picked action is performed here as if the toggle had been off.
